### Q1 For each customer, identify their highest order and tag it as 'Top Order', all others as 'Regular'.
SELECT *,
CASE
    WHEN RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY total_amount DESC) = 1 THEN 'top_order'
    ELSE 'regular'
END AS order_tag
FROM campusx.orders_sample;
 
### Q2 For every order, calculate the number of days since that customerâ€™s previous order.
SELECT *, 
       DATEDIFF(order_date, LAG(order_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date)) AS days_since_last_order
FROM orders_sample;

### Q3 For each customer, calculate what percentage of their total spend each individual order represents.
SELECT *,SUM(total_amount) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id) AS customer_total, 
total_amount*100/(SUM(total_amount) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id)) AS percentage_of_total
FROM orders_sample;

### Q4 Find the top 3 customers who placed the most number of orders. In case of a tie, use total_amount sum as a tiebreaker.
SELECT *,
       RANK() OVER(ORDER BY orders DESC, total_spend DESC) AS 'rank'
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id,
           COUNT(order_id) AS orders,
           SUM(total_amount) AS total_spend
    FROM orders_sample
    GROUP BY customer_id
) t;

### Q5 For each order, calculate the average total_amount of the current and previous two orders for that customer (rolling 3-order average).
SELECT *,
AVG(total_amount) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg
FROM orders_sample;
